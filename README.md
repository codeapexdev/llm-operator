## Introduction

The LLM operator a simple web agent which can browse internet. It is using Next.js, OpenAI API, Playwright, Stagehand, BrowserBase and Tailwind CSS. The key components and workflow consist of NLP leveraging OpenAI's GPT 4o Mini API, command conversion using stagehand, Action execution which involves a generated browser operations which are executed on BrowserBase.

At the heart of the system is a simple yet effective agent loop. This loop continuously processes user input, converts it via Stagehand, and executes the resulting operations with BrowserBase, thereby creating a dynamic and responsive web agent.

## How It Works

Web agents are usually complicated and require a set of complex tasks to make it work properly. To make it work, you need to understand the user's intent and then convert it into an headless browser operations, and execute actions. You also have to make sure it doesn't get blocked by those irritating Captcha [I AM NOT A ROBOT] blockers. Those actions can also be incredibly complex on their own.

The project uses Stagehand which is a great tool that helps in building web agents. It allows you to convert the natural language into a headless browser operations. It can also execute the actions on the browser and extract results in structured data.

This application is a very simple agent loop that just calls Stagehand to convert the user's intent into a headless browser operations and then call BrowserBase to execute those operations.

In simple language, BrowserBase is a no headache headless browser which is used in AI Space. Your agent can browse the internet easily using the Agent.
